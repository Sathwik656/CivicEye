Introduction
With increasing traffic violations posing safety risks, leveraging modern technology to enhance traffic monitoring has become a necessity. Our project introduces an innovative software solution that detects and records traffic violations using home-based CCTV systems. By integrating with users' existing CCTV setups, our platform employs advanced object detection models to identify specific violations, such as riding without a helmet. The system notifies users with detailed reports, including captured images, enabling them to stay informed about nearby violations. This project bridges the gap between personal surveillance and public safety, promoting a culture of responsible driving.

Objectives
1) Automated Traffic Violation Detection: Use state-of-the-art YOLOv3 object detection to identify and capture violations like riding without a helmet in real-time through home-based CCTV footage.

2) User Integration and Monitoring: Develop a user-friendly website where individuals can log in, link their CCTV IP addresses, and monitor violations recorded by their cameras.

3) Efficient Reporting System: Provide users with detailed images and information about violations occurring near their homes, ensuring easy access to evidence for potential action.

4) Scalable and Secure Solution: Create a robust platform that securely integrates with multiple CCTV systems, ensuring user data is protected while maintaining high performance.

5) Promote Road Safety: Contribute to the reduction of traffic violations and the promotion of safer driving practices by empowering individuals to monitor and report unsafe behavior.
